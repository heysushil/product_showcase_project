# Product Show case project

In this project I'm going to workin on following taks and at the last of this project we will add/edit/show/delete any product.

## These are following task on this project
1. Create table products and add the columns - id, product_name, product_price, product_desccription, product_image(save multiple images).

1. Create add/edit/list/delete product form with the above-mentioned field and image upload should be multiple. (do not refresh the page)

1. Use Jquery, ajax for all operations you perform for listing, use data tables or bootstrap datatable, or something like that.

1. Use Codeigniter, Jquery, ajax, and Bootstrap, and try to complete this task in 3-4 hours.

1. Upload your task in Github and share the link on the same email thread.

## Project Details: Point wise

1. In this project have 1 controller, one modal and one html page. In single page using ajax and jquery trying do all work.
1. Used same model to add new product including images means multipal images. You can seleted multipal images on the time of selection form you local system.

## Challenges

1. When trying to get product and product related images data on model, on that time I wanted the product id on php but not succeded then tried to pass the data form jqeury to controller then get the data related to one product and showed that on jquery and onclick pass the data to controller for update the product related details and recived responce on ajax and again showed that on jquery. 

## Want to contribute: These points still remains 


1. On single image click case, any one first image detale successfully but then on next to thired click the images data disapear form here. Because I show the image realated data by using this id <show-related-images>, in <product_showcase.php> view page. I founded few options but didn't worked so I commented them on the same page. Might this will help you.
